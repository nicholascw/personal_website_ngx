## Biography

I am a second-year PhD student in [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://cs.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Gang Wang](https://gangw.cs.illinois.edu). My  research interests include security and privacy in general, networking, measurement, censorship and cybercrime, and embedded systems. Apart from my profession, my enthusiasm also covers Aviations, Motorsports, Photography, Mechanical Engineering, and some other acativities that overlaps with other engineering and sciences fields. I am a FAA-licensed private pilot.

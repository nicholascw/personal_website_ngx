To whom it may concern,

Hi!

It is been a long time seems my last update on my blog. For those who've been 
here before, you may noticed a radical change here. **Yes, you are in the right place.**
Due to the fact that my last generateion blog system was built on an 
under-maintained PHP open source CMS platform and hosted on an Arch Linux system 
which had its package manager database accidentally delete sometime in 2019, 
I finally decide to discard the whole system and host a new static version of 
my blog for the sake of simplicity, robustness, availability and reliability. 
It is also true that I am gradually switching from Chinese content to English 
content in order to share my articles with a wider audience.

As for the old content, since I still hold a copy of my old blog, I may recover 
some of the archived articles and translate them into English, however I do not
have an ETA for that. I believe there is also an archived copy of my old blog on
[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210208213630/https://www.nicho1as.wang/), 
you may want to check it out if you are looking for a specific old blog post.

Thank you all for your visit, and hope you have a fresh start in 2021 just like this blog!

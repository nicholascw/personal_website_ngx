here before, you may noticed a radical change here. <strong>Yes, you are in the right place.</strong>
Due to the fact that my last generation blog system was built on top of an
under-maintained PHP open source CMS platform and hosted with an Arch Linux system
which had its package manager database accidentally delete sometime in 2019,
I finally decide to discard the whole system and host a new static version of
my blog for the sake of simplicity, robustness, availability and reliability.
It is also true that I am gradually switching from Chinese content to English
content in order to share my articles with a wider audience.</p><p>As for the old content, since I still hold a copy of my old blog, I may recover
some of the archived articles and translate them into English, however I do not
have an ETA for that. I believe there is also an archived copy of my old blog on
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20210208213630/https://www.nicho1as.wang/>archive.org</a>,
you may want to check it out if you are looking for a specific old blog post.</p><p>Thank you all for your visit, and hope you have a fresh start in 2021 just like this blog!</p><p>&ndash;

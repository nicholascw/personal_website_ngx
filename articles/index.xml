Hi!
It is been a long time seems my last update on my blog. For those who&amp;rsquo;ve been here before, you may noticed a radical change here. Yes, you are in the right place. Due to the fact that my last generateion blog system was built on an under-maintained PHP open source CMS platform and hosted on an Arch Linux system which had its package manager database accidentally delete sometime in 2019, I finally decide to discard the whole system and host a new static version of my blog for the sake of simplicity, robustness, availability and reliability.</description></item></channel></rss>

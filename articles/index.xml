&lt;p>Hi!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is been a long time since my last update on my blog. For those who&amp;rsquo;ve been
here before, you may noticed a radical change here. &lt;strong>Yes, you are in the right place.&lt;/strong>
Due to the fact that my last generation blog system was built on top of an
under-maintained PHP open source CMS platform and hosted with an Arch Linux system
which had its package manager database accidentally delete sometime in 2019,
I finally decide to discard the whole system and host a new static version of
my blog for the sake of simplicity, robustness, availability and reliability.
It is also true that I am gradually switching from Chinese content to English
content in order to share my articles with a wider audience.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

It is extremely biased towards the attack perspective and at the same time a piece of summary that only reflects personal experience and impression of my own.</p><p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since last time I actually tries to write an article.
However, moving along the path doing cybersecurity-related works,
I feel that I have more and more stuff I want express, explain, and discuss with anybody who is or is not related to the field.
I finally decided to share my very personal and impressonal understanding to the security mindset in a few words today.</p><p>I have always been saying &ldquo;I am an extremely engieenring person.&rdquo; So, what is engineering in the first place?
According to Wikipedia, &ldquo;Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures,
and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.&rdquo;<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering>[1]</a>
Why does it matter? Well, if you happen to notice the title, I call security works &ldquo;Engineering Engineering.&rdquo;
While other Engineering fields utilize their related field to build &ldquo;useful stuff&rdquo;, security people,
tend to take what&rsquo;s already there and think how exactly can we make use of them, potentially in an unintended way.
Whenever I have anything new in my view, it quickly goes into the following sequence:</p><p>(sorry, but it feels more comfortable for me to describe soemthing with C-style pseudo code when logic and control flow is needed):</p><pre tabindex=0><code>auto *capabilities[];

void search(auto obj_in){
    auto *obj = &amp;obj_in;
    while(obj) {
        What is *obj?

        What does or can *obj do? =&gt; save into capabilities[];

        What does it mean it have such capability? =&gt; develop aliases to the capability, save into capabilities[];
            - what does it actually allowing me to to?
            - try explain it in different ways;
            - try identify the features of the subject and object;

        How does it achieve such capability? =&gt; discover &#34;children&#34; or &#34;private properties&#34; of *obj (think it as a tree or a class);
            - learn its internanl mechenaism;
            - learn what does it utilized in order to achieve such capability;
            - sometimes, what are required in order to do such capabilities? what&#39;s not required?

        and, finally we fork bomb it by for(i : children)search(children);
    }
}

int main() {
  run search() against anything I randomly in mind;
  wait until my brain hangs, or memory exhausted;
  look into my capabilities[] in the end;
  do &#34;capabilities[] engineering&#34; with my best effort;
  return 0;
}
</code></pre><p>It may be hard for some people to understand without a more vivid example to this process:</p><p><em>&lt; TODO: But I am not coming up with any elegant examples to help you at this moment ◔ ‸◔ , sorry! ></em></p><p>Essentially, yes, I do enjoy the process of tearing down whatever stuff in my hand to see what can it do in different states.
Quoting Kirill, &ldquo;You like breaking up things.&rdquo; Obviously it does not only apply to Computer Security,
so I totally understand that sometimes people see me as a paranoid when I start to argue against some natural,
plain languages, questioning absolute statements, come up with ridiculous exceptions, etc. However, sorry,
I do intrinsically thinking like that even before I have anything to do with security researches. Quoting Michel,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely not only about computers.&rdquo;</p><p>Repurposing. Yes, a lot of the times it&rsquo;s exactly to repurpose to an extreme, and a lot of the rest are looking for minorities in sets: people always say that I&rsquo;m somewhat &ldquo;general purpose edge cases generator&rdquo; when it comes to poll option designing.</p><p>There are some thoughts from the defense side but much less that I would like to cover. Think this is enough for today.</p><p><em>&lt; TODO: I&rsquo;ll call this article WIP, but probably I will never come back to update ></em></p><p>&ndash;
